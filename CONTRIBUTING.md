# Contributing to Kerntopia

## Welcome Contributors! ðŸŒ¾âœ¨

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Kerntopia! This project aims to democratize GPU compute development through SLANG. Kerntopia welcomes contributions that advance this mission.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To ensure the project can potentially evolve in the future while protecting all contributors, a **Contributor License Agreement** is required for all pull requests.

### What This Means

By submitting a contribution to this project, you agree to the following terms:

3. **Developer Certificate of Origin**: All commits must include a "Signed-off-by" line indicating acceptance of the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).

### How to Sign Your Commits

Add the `-s` flag to your git commits:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add awesome new kernel for matrix multiplication"
```

This adds a `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>` line to your commit message, indicating you certify the contribution under the DCO.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

By signing off on commits, you certify that:

## Contribution Process

### 1. Before You Start

- **Check Issues**: Look for existing issues or create one to discuss your contribution
- **Contact First**: For major changes, please contact the maintainer first
- **Follow Conventions**: Review existing code to understand project conventions

### 2. Development Workflow

```bash
# Fork the repository and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kerntopia.git
cd kerntopia

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/awesome-new-kernel

# Make your changes with signed commits
git add .
git commit -s -m "Add matrix multiplication kernel with CUDA optimization"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/awesome-new-kernel

# Create a pull request
```

### 3. Pull Request Requirements

Your pull request must:

- âœ… **Include signed commits** (DCO compliance)
- âœ… **Pass all existing tests** 
- âœ… **Include new tests** for new functionality
- âœ… **Follow code style conventions**
- âœ… **Include documentation** for new features
- âœ… **Reference related issues** (if applicable)

### 4. Review Process

1. **Code Review**: Maintainer will review code, documentation, and tests
2. **Feedback**: Address any requested changes
3. **Merge**: Once approved, your contribution will be merged

## Code Standards

### Code Style
- **C++**: Follow existing formatting and naming conventions
- **SLANG**: Use clear comments for complex algorithms
- **CMake**: Follow project CMake patterns
- **Python**: PEP 8 compliance for wrapper scripts

### Documentation
- **Function Comments**: Document all public functions with purpose and parameters
- **Kernel Documentation**: Each kernel should have its own README.md
- **Educational Focus**: Comments should help others learn, not just maintain

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: All new functionality requires tests
- **Integration Tests**: Backend-specific tests for new kernels
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks for performance-critical code
