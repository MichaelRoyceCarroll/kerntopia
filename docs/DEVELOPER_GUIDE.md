## Quick Start (Current)

For now, the best way to get started with kernel development is:

1. **Study the existing implementation:**
   ```bash
   # Examine the working conv2d kernel
   cd src/tests/conv2d/
   ls -la
   ```

2. **Use the vector_add template:**
   ```bash
   # Copy and modify the template
   cp -r examples/vector_add my_new_kernel
   cd my_new_kernel
   # Edit the SLANG kernel and CMake files
   ```

3. **Follow contribution guidelines:**
   - Review [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
   - Study existing code patterns
   - Ensure proper testing and documentation

## Coming Soon

This guide will be significantly expanded as the project reaches wider adoption and more contributors join the ecosystem. Priority areas include:

- **Kernel Template System**: Streamlined process for adding new kernels
- **Backend Extension Guide**: How to add support for new GPU APIs
- **Performance Analysis Tools**: Built-in profiling and optimization guidance
- **Educational Content Framework**: Guidelines for creating learning materials

## Community Resources

While the comprehensive developer guide is in development, you can:

- **Browse Examples**: Check out [examples/vector_add/](../examples/vector_add/)
- **Study Working Code**: Examine the conv2d implementation in [src/tests/conv2d/](../src/tests/conv2d/)
- **Ask Questions**: Open GitHub issues with the `question` label
- **Join Discussions**: Participate in GitHub Discussions

---

**Contribution Opportunity**: This developer guide needs expert contributors! If you have experience with GPU development, SLANG, or educational content creation, your contributions would be invaluable.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to help expand this guide.
