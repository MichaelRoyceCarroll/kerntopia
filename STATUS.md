# Kerntopia Development Status

**Date:** 20250905 12:00 Pacific Time

## Current Plan

**DYNAMIC DEVICE DETECTION PREPARATION COMPLETE**
- ✅ **Test Case Simplification** - Commented out D1 (device 1) test cases in conv2d_test.cpp
- ✅ **Future Scalability Documentation** - Added placeholder comments for dynamic device detection
- ✅ **CLI Documentation Updated** - Added future enhancement notes to --device examples
- ✅ **GTest Filter Documentation** - Added dynamic detection notes to D0 filter examples

**Status: Code Prepared for Future Dynamic Device Detection** - All hardcoded device 1 references are now commented out with clear documentation about future dynamic device interrogation. Test suite currently only creates D0 test cases while preserving structure for future multi-device support.

## What's implemented/working

- ✅ **DYNAMIC DEVICE DETECTION PREP** - Codebase prepared for future multi-device support
  - Test cases simplified to D0 only with clear future enhancement documentation
  - CLI examples marked with dynamic detection placeholders  
  - GTest filter examples documented for future scalability
  - Hardcoded device 1 references commented out with helpful notes
- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE HELP SYSTEM** - Unified help architecture with context-sensitive support
  - Main help: `kerntopia --help` shows complete feature overview
  - Context help: `kerntopia run --help`, `kerntopia info --help`, `kerntopia list --help`
  - GTest integration: Full documentation of filtering and test discovery
  - Accurate examples: Real usage patterns with current kernel status
- ✅ **LOGGING SYSTEM CONSISTENCY** - Fixed cross-mode logging behavior  
  - Regular mode: Clean WARNING+ output by default, `--logger` toggles work
  - GTest mode: Same clean logging behavior, no more INFO spam
  - Level system: -1=silent, 0=normal, 1=info, 2=debug with word alternatives
- ✅ **UNIFIED SYSTEMINTERROGATOR ARCHITECTURE** - Both CUDA and Vulkan backends use consistent runtime detection pattern
- ✅ **REAL VULKAN DEVICE ENUMERATION** - Actual Vulkan API calls provide proper device information
- ✅ **VULKAN DARK IMAGE BUG RESOLVED** - float4x4 matrix approach fixes std140 layout inconsistencies
- ✅ **PERFECT CROSS-BACKEND CONSISTENCY** - CUDA and Vulkan produce identical, bright, correctly blurred images
- ✅ **CUDA BACKEND VERIFICATION** - Working perfectly, generates correct blurred output images
- ✅ **VULKAN BACKEND FUNCTIONAL** - Complete transformation from black output to perfect Gaussian blur

## What's in progress  

- Future dynamic device detection implementation 
- Additional kernel implementations (vector_add, bilateral_filter, etc.)

## Immediate next tasks

- Implement dynamic device detection to replace hardcoded D0/D1 test cases
- Create system interrogation for multi-GPU test case generation
- Implement additional kernels using proven SystemInterrogator pattern
- Continue expanding kernel roster with proper help documentation

## Key decisions made

- **SINGLE-DEVICE TESTING APPROACH** - Simplified test cases to D0 only while preserving future multi-device architecture
- **PLACEHOLDER DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY** - Added clear "future: dynamic device detection" comments throughout codebase
- **UNIFIED HELP ARCHITECTURE** - Single source of truth in CommandLineParser::GetHelpText() with context-sensitive extensions
- **LOGGING CONSISTENCY** - Same clean default behavior across regular mode and GTest mode
- **FLOAT4X4 MATRIX APPROACH** - Use `float4x4` in SLANG and `float[4][4]` in C++ to avoid std140 array stride issues
- **UNIFIED SYSTEMINTERROGATOR PATTERN** - Both CUDA and Vulkan backends follow identical runtime detection architecture

## Any blockers encountered

### Recently Resolved
- ✅ **HARDCODED DEVICE TESTING** - Multiple device test cases created without dynamic detection. Fixed by commenting out D1 cases with future enhancement documentation
- ✅ **MISSING FUTURE SCALABILITY DOCS** - CLI examples referenced device 1 without indicating placeholder status. Fixed by adding "future: dynamic device detection" comments
- ✅ **GTEST MODE LOGGING INCONSISTENCY** - GTest mode bypassed logging configuration. Fixed by adding Logger::Initialize() to RunPureGTestMode()
- ✅ **VULKAN DARK IMAGE BUG** - Root cause: SLANG std140 array stride differences between CUDA/Vulkan
- ✅ **VULKAN SYSTEMINTERROGATOR BYPASS** - Root cause: Vulkan backend used global-space detection instead of SystemInterrogator

### Current Issues
- None - codebase prepared for future dynamic device detection implementation
