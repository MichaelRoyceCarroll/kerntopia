# Kerntopia Development Status

**Date:** 20250904 18:13 Pacific Time

## Current Plan

**USER EXPERIENCE & INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETE**
- ✅ **Logging System Fixed** - Resolved memory leak issues from CUDA driver initialization failures
- ✅ **Help System Overhaul** - Comprehensive, accurate help with context-sensitive support
- ✅ **GTest Integration Documented** - Full documentation of --gtest_filter and --gtest_list_tests capabilities  
- ✅ **CPU Backend Clarified** - Removed misleading "CPU (Software)" from available backends list

**Status: User Interface Polish Complete** - All help output accurately reflects current implementation, logging works consistently across execution modes, and system info correctly represents available vs placeholder backends.

## What's implemented/working

- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE HELP SYSTEM** - Unified help architecture with context-sensitive support
  - Main help: `kerntopia --help` shows complete feature overview
  - Context help: `kerntopia run --help`, `kerntopia info --help`, `kerntopia list --help`
  - GTest integration: Full documentation of filtering and test discovery
  - Accurate examples: Real usage patterns with current kernel status
- ✅ **LOGGING SYSTEM CONSISTENCY** - Fixed cross-mode logging behavior  
  - Regular mode: Clean WARNING+ output by default, `--logger` toggles work
  - GTest mode: Same clean logging behavior, no more INFO spam
  - Level system: -1=silent, 0=normal, 1=info, 2=debug with word alternatives
- ✅ **CUDA MEMORY LEAK RESOLUTION** - Fixed WSL2 CUDA driver initialization issues
  - Root cause: CUDA driver internal allocations during failed cuInit() calls
  - Solution: Not our bug - external driver issue, resolved by CUDA SDK update
- ✅ **CPU BACKEND CLARIFICATION** - Removed misleading placeholder backend
  - System info no longer shows "CPU (Software)" as available
  - Backend properly marked as placeholder for future development
  - Clear distinction from Vulkan-exposed backends
- ✅ **JIT MODE DOCUMENTATION** - Marked --jit flag as "NOT IMPLEMENTED" while preserving toggle
- ✅ **UNIFIED SYSTEMINTERROGATOR ARCHITECTURE** - Both CUDA and Vulkan backends use consistent runtime detection pattern
- ✅ **REAL VULKAN DEVICE ENUMERATION** - Actual Vulkan API calls provide proper device information
- ✅ **VULKAN DARK IMAGE BUG RESOLVED** - float4x4 matrix approach fixes std140 layout inconsistencies
- ✅ **PERFECT CROSS-BACKEND CONSISTENCY** - CUDA and Vulkan produce identical, bright, correctly blurred images
- ✅ **CUDA BACKEND VERIFICATION** - Working perfectly, generates correct blurred output images
- ✅ **VULKAN BACKEND FUNCTIONAL** - Complete transformation from black output to perfect Gaussian blur

## What's in progress  

- Future kernel implementations (vector_add, bilateral_filter, etc.)
- Additional backend optimizations and features

## Immediate next tasks

- Implement additional kernels using proven SystemInterrogator pattern
- Continue expanding kernel roster with proper help documentation
- Explore performance benchmarking suite capabilities
- Consider standalone executable help system consistency

## Key decisions made

- **UNIFIED HELP ARCHITECTURE** - Single source of truth in CommandLineParser::GetHelpText() with context-sensitive extensions
- **LOGGING CONSISTENCY** - Same clean default behavior across regular mode and GTest mode
- **ACCURATE FEATURE DOCUMENTATION** - Help reflects current implementation state, not planned features
- **PLACEHOLDER TRANSPARENCY** - Clear marking of unimplemented features (JIT, CPU backend) while preserving development hooks
- **GTEST INTEGRATION DOCUMENTATION** - Full coverage of advanced filtering capabilities for power users
- **MEMORY LEAK ATTRIBUTION** - Identified and documented external CUDA driver issues vs application code
- **FLOAT4X4 MATRIX APPROACH** - Use `float4x4` in SLANG and `float[4][4]` in C++ to avoid std140 array stride issues
- **UNIFIED SYSTEMINTERROGATOR PATTERN** - Both CUDA and Vulkan backends follow identical runtime detection architecture

## Any blockers encountered

### Recently Resolved
- ✅ **GTEST MODE LOGGING INCONSISTENCY** - GTest mode bypassed logging configuration. Fixed by adding Logger::Initialize() to RunPureGTestMode()
- ✅ **MISLEADING HELP OUTPUT** - Outdated help text with missing/incorrect features. Fixed with comprehensive help system overhaul
- ✅ **CPU BACKEND CONFUSION** - Placeholder backend shown as available. Fixed by proper marking and removal from available list
- ✅ **CUDA MEMORY LEAKS** - WSL2 driver initialization failures. Resolved by CUDA SDK update (external issue)
- ✅ **JIT MODE CONFUSION** - Toggle existed but wasn't implemented. Fixed by clear "NOT IMPLEMENTED" marking
- ✅ **VULKAN SYSTEMINTERROGATOR BYPASS** - Root cause: Vulkan backend used global-space detection instead of SystemInterrogator
- ✅ **VULKAN DARK IMAGE BUG** - Root cause: SLANG std140 array stride differences between CUDA/Vulkan

### Minor Outstanding Issues
- None currently - all major user experience and functional issues resolved
