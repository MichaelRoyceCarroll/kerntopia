# Kerntopia Development Status

**Date:** 2025-08-12 19:36 Pacific Time

## Current Plan

**PHASE 3 MVP KERNEL IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED!** Implemented complete multi-backend testing framework with corrected SLANG profile naming, full Vulkan backend implementation, and end-to-end command line integration. Fixed critical architecture issues with SystemInterrogator integration. The project is organized into 6 phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Build System** (✅ **100% COMPLETE**)
2. **Phase 2: SLANG Compilation & Kernel Management** (✅ **100% COMPLETE**)
3. **Phase 3: MVP Kernel Implementation** (✅ **100% COMPLETE** - All backend implementations and testing infrastructure ready)
   - ✅ Phase 3.1: CUDA Backend Implementation (PTX loading, memory management, timing)
   - ✅ Phase 3.2: Vulkan Backend Implementation (SPIR-V loading, memory management, compute pipeline)
   - ✅ Phase 3.3: SLANG Profile Naming Correction (cuda_sm_7_0 profile × target combinations)
   - ✅ Phase 3.4: JIT/precompiled command line modes
   - ✅ Phase 3.5: Conv2D test implementation with ImageKernelTest framework
   - ✅ Phase 3.6: Command line to GTest integration with backend validation
   - ✅ Phase 3.7: End-to-end testing validation and architecture fixes
4. **Phase 4: Execution Modes** (READY TO START)
5. **Phase 5: Python Orchestration Wrapper** (PENDING)  
6. **Phase 6: Documentation & Polish** (PENDING)

**Complete MVP testing framework operational. Ready for Phase 4 execution mode implementation with standalone kernel executables and advanced test orchestration.**

## What's implemented/working

- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE TEST FRAMEWORK** - BaseKernelTest with GTest integration, parameterized testing, statistical analysis
- ✅ **CUDA BACKEND FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - CudaKernelRunner with PTX loading, memory management, timing events
- ✅ **FIXED CUDA DETECTION** - SystemInterrogator now finds actual CUDA driver (`/usr/lib/wsl/lib/libcuda.so.1`) instead of SDK dev libraries
- ✅ **IMAGE TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE** - ImageData structure, ImageLoader framework, image comparison utilities ready for STB integration
- ✅ **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES** - Performance testing with multiple iterations, coefficient of variation tracking, PSNR calculation
- ✅ **PARAMETERIZED TEST SUPPORT** - `KERNTOPIA_TEST_ALL_BACKENDS` macro for automatic multi-backend testing
- ✅ **PERFORMANCE TEST MACROS** - `KERNTOPIA_PERFORMANCE_TEST` with configurable iterations and consistency validation
- ✅ **BACKEND AVAILABILITY CHECKING** - Integrated with SystemInterrogator for runtime backend validation
- ✅ **WORKING KERNEL COMPILATION** - All SLANG kernels compile to SPIR-V/PTX successfully
- ✅ **SLANG INTEGRATION COMPLETE** - Build-time and runtime JIT detection working
- ✅ **UNIFIED SYSTEM INTERROGATION** - SystemInterrogator provides consistent detection across all runtimes

## What's in progress

- Nothing - Phase 3.3 BaseKernelTest framework fully completed with all features working

## Immediate next tasks

1. **Phase 3.4: JIT/Precompiled Command Line Modes** - Add `--jit`, `--precompiled` flags with validation and fallback logic
2. **Phase 3.5: Conv2D Test Implementation** - Create working Conv2D test using BaseKernelTest framework with image loading and validation  
3. **Phase 3.6: KernelManager Integration** - Connect KernelManager and TestOrchestrator for complete execution pipeline
4. **Phase 3.7: End-to-End Testing** - Validate complete workflow across CUDA/Vulkan backends with real kernel execution

## Key decisions made

- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE TEST ARCHITECTURE** - BaseKernelTest provides virtual ExecuteKernel() for derived classes, comprehensive statistical analysis
- ✅ **IMAGE TESTING SCAFFOLDING** - ImageData/ImageLoader designed to play nice with STB/TinyEXR without future rewiring needs
- ✅ **CUDA DRIVER DETECTION REFINEMENT** - Changed search patterns from generic `{"libcuda", "cuda", "nvcuda"}` to specific `{"libcuda.so"}` to avoid SDK dev libraries
- ✅ **WSL-AWARE CUDA DETECTION** - Priority order: RuntimeLoader dynamic search FIRST, then WSL/standard fallback paths
- ✅ **BACKENFACTORY STATIC PATTERN** - Test framework uses BackendFactory static methods rather than singleton instance management
- ✅ **STATISTICAL PERFORMANCE VALIDATION** - Tests verify coefficient of variation <15% for performance consistency
- ✅ **PARAMETERIZED MULTI-BACKEND TESTING** - Automatic testing across CUDA/Vulkan/CPU with proper skip logic for unavailable backends

## Any blockers encountered

- **No blockers** - Phase 3.3 test framework FULLY COMPLETE with comprehensive GTest integration
- **CUDA detection issue resolved** - Now correctly finds NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU via WSL driver library  
- **Test compilation successful** - All BaseKernelTest framework components build and link correctly
- **Image testing scaffolding validated** - ImageData/ImageLoader architecture confirmed compatible with future STB/TinyEXR integration
- **Ready for Phase 3.4** - JIT/precompiled command line mode implementation can begin with solid test framework foundation
